Rummikub How to win:
    -Have most points after a predetermined number of rounds (usually 3-5)

    -A tile's points is worth by the number on it
        -A joker has 30 points

    -To get points, the first to empty your hand in the round, gains the combined score of remaining tiles in other players' hands 
        -The other players score negative (minus) points on the combined score of their respective hand
            player 1 emptied their hand,
            player 2 has a combined score of 10, so -10 is scored
            player 3 has a combined score of 19, so -19 is scored

            player 1 gains 10 + 19 = 29 points
